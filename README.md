# syllables
Excerpt from a language project. Create a set of syllable patterns and syllables as a basis to an aesthetically consistent language.

Consider e.g. English syllables, which have the general form (C)^3 V (C)^5. However, not all consonants are eligible for every position, so much more structure needs to be obeyed to produce an english-sounding/looking syllable.
The table at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_phonology#Phonotactics, e.g., shows possible onsets and codas. The code attempts to create a number of such subpatterns to limit the number of possible syllables. The fewer patterns, the more recognizable a random word will look.
